# Developer Guide

Before start, please read this basic guideline as first step.

## Routing
We are using gatsby-plugin-page-creator to generate pages, js files under src/pages will turn into pages automatically but some of the files/folders are excluded.

Custom ignore patterns: [`**/components/**`]
Default igonre patterns: [`template-*`, `__tests__/*`, `*.test.jsx?`, `*.spec.jsx?`, `*.d.tsx?`, `*.json`, `*.yaml`, `_*`, `.*`]
Based on this rule, you can write styles.js, *.test.js and your own components under 'components' folder without worrying those files would be turned into pages.


## Paths & Imports

There are few basic rules for importing files.

```js
//import node modules from third party libs as first part
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { navigate } from 'gatsby';
import Grid from '@material-ui/core/Grid';

//import internal functional(sagas/actions/reducers/actiontypes) as sencond part
import { requestTrafficImages } from '../../../actions';

//import mockup data as thrid part
import mockData from ../__Mocks/mock.json';
```
Do not add any files into ./public or ./.cache folder as those folders are functional and generated by gatsby.js. Instead, please use static folder as an assets collection.

## Fetching Data

We are using Redux-Saga and fetch for data retrieving, and there are few rules for your references.

```js
Use Fetch from utils instead of "whatwg-fetch".
import Fetch from '/utils/fetch';
...
Fetch.get(url);
Fetch.put(url, postbody);
Fetch.post(url, postbody, additionalHeader);
```
